## Files inputs (deploy/files/)

The templates in `deploy/files/` are mounted into services and must be filled with your site‑specific values. Use your IP plan, DNS domain, and certificate authority to derive the values; avoid copying any sample values.

- `deploy/files/carbide-api/admin_root_cert_pem` – place the PEM‑encoded root CA chain used to authenticate Carbide admins (matches the CA trusted by the admin CLI). Generate this from your CA and keep private keys elsewhere.
- `deploy/files/carbide-api/carbide-api-site-config.toml` – set site identifiers (`ENVIRONMENT_NAME`, `SITE_DOMAIN_NAME`), admin network pool and gateway, service VIPs (API, DHCP, DNS, PXE, SSH console, NGINX/proxy, Unbound), tenant overlay prefixes, and IPMI pools/names for controllers and managed hosts. Ensure service VIPs come from your chosen /27 (or equivalent) VIP pool and that IPMI pools each have a gateway and unique network name.
- `deploy/files/unbound/forwarders.conf` – list upstream recursive DNS endpoints reachable from the cluster. Use IPs for resolvers allowed to recurse for your site.
- `deploy/files/unbound/local_data.conf` – defines static DNS A records for Carbide services, including all `.forge` service endpoints (API, PXE, static PXE, NTP, Unbound, otel-receiver, and SOCKS proxy) and any additional site-specific names (e.g., `api-<ENVIRONMENT_NAME>.<SITE_DOMAIN_NAME>`). Map each hostname to the corresponding service VIP you selected above. Several `.forge` hostnames are hardcoded in compiled binaries and must resolve correctly before DPU agents can start. See [`.forge` DNS Zone — Service Endpoint Reference](DNS.md) for the full list of hostnames, required ports, and which entries are hardcoded.
- `deploy/files/kea_config.json` – provide the Kea DHCPv4 configuration tailored to your admin/tenant networks, including option definitions, subnets, pools, and relay settings. Reference the same service IPs used elsewhere and ensure leases align with the admin network pool.
- `deploy/files/vtysh.conf` – FRRouting vtysh shell configuration. Align hostname and service addresses here with the FRR service IPs chosen from your service VIP pool.

After populating `deploy/kustomization.yaml` and all files under `deploy/files/`, deploy everything with:

```bash
kustomize build . --enable-helm --enable-alpha-plugins --enable-exec | kubectl apply -f -
```

# Carbide core services (bare‑metal provisioning)

This document summarizes the Kubernetes components that make up the **Carbide core** bare‑metal provisioning system and how to get started deploying them.

Carbide is responsible for:

- Managing the full lifecycle of bare‑metal machines in one or more L2 networks (subnets).
- Owning DHCP and IP addressing within those subnets.
- Discovering new machines automatically
- Driving machines through a state machine using power control (IPMI / Redfish).
- Inventorying hardware
- Exposing a single **gRPC API** that all Carbide services and external clients talk to.

All examples below assume you have chosen a namespace such as **`forge-system`**; adjust as needed.

---

## Carbide API

**Role**  
The **carbide‑api** deployment is the control‑plane API for all bare‑metal operations. Other Carbide services (DHCP, DNS, hardware‑health, PXE, UI, etc.) and cloud components talk to this service over mTLS‑protected gRPC.

### What it deploys

Path: `deploy/carbide-base/api/`

- Deployment `carbide-api` (gRPC API)
- Job `carbide-api-migrate` (database migrations)
- Services
    - `carbide-api` – gRPC, port **1079**
    - `carbide-api-metrics` – metrics, port **1080**
    - `carbide-api-profiler` – profiler, port **1081**
- ConfigMaps
    - `carbide-api-config-files` – base config (`carbide-api-config.toml`, `casbin-policy.csv`)
    - `carbide-api-site-config-files` – overlay for site‑specific TOML (empty in base)
- TLS
    - `Certificate/carbide-api-certificate` → `Secret/carbide-api-certificate` (SPIFFE‑style mTLS)
- RBAC
    - `ServiceAccount/carbide-api`
    - `Role/RoleBinding carbide-api` – allows creating cert‑manager `CertificateRequest`s

### External inputs you must provide

- **Database access**
    - Secret with DB credentials: `<CARBIDE_DB_CREDENTIALS_SECRET>` (keys: `username`, `password`)
    - ConfigMap for DB endpoint: `<CARBIDE_DB_CONFIGMAP>` (keys: `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_NAME`)
- **Vault access**
    - Secret `<CARBIDE_VAULT_TOKEN_SECRET>` or AppRole secret with `VAULT_ROLE_ID` / `VAULT_SECRET_ID`
    - ConfigMap `<VAULT_CLUSTER_INFO_CONFIGMAP>` with
        - `VAULT_SERVICE`
        - `CARBIDE_VAULT_MOUNT`
        - `CARBIDE_VAULT_PKI_MOUNT`
- **Root CA bundle**
    - Secret `<CARBIDE_ROOT_CA_SECRET>` mounted where `carbide-api-config.toml` expects it.

### Configuration notes

- Runtime config lives in `carbide-api-config.toml` and is overlaid by a site‑specific TOML in `carbide-api-site-config-files`.
- Important knobs include:
    - listen/metrics/profiler ports
    - firmware/DPU settings
    - site explorer enablement
    - TLS paths under `[tls]` (aligned with the SPIFFE Secret mount)
    - Casbin policy path under `[auth]`
- For SA / lab environments it is common to run with **permissive authorization** (for example by enabling an “allow all trusted certs” rule in the Casbin policy). A hardened deployment should tighten these rules.

### Quick start

1. Create the DB credentials Secret and DB endpoint ConfigMap for your environment.
2. Create the Vault token/AppRole Secret and Vault cluster ConfigMap.
3. Optionally add a `carbide-api-site-config.toml` via an overlay and include it in `carbide-api-site-config-files`.
4. Apply the base (or your overlay):

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k deploy/carbide-base/api -n <CARBIDE_NAMESPACE>
   ```

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k deploy/carbide-base -n <CARBIDE_NAMESPACE>
   ```

---

## Carbide Unbound Base

**Role**  
`carbide-unbound` provides a **recursive DNS resolver** for Carbide deployments. Authoritative services (like `carbide-dns`) can forward unknown lookups here, and the included exporter publishes Prometheus metrics for Unbound.

### What it deploys

Path: `deploy/carbide-unbound-base/`

- Deployment `carbide-unbound` with the Unbound server and `unbound_exporter` sidecar (config reload via Stakater reloader annotations).
- Service `carbide-unbound` – DNS on UDP/TCP **53**, metrics on TCP **9167**.
- ConfigMaps
    - `unbound-envvars` from `unbound.env` (sets `LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR`, `BROKEN_DNSSEC`, `UNBOUND_CONTROL_DIR`).
    - `unbound-local-config` from `local.conf.d/*.conf`, including access controls, verbosity, extended statistics, and an `unknowndomain` blocklist plus a placeholder `forwarders.conf` you should replace with your upstream resolvers.
- Volumes
    - ConfigMap mount at `/etc/unbound/local.conf.d`
    - EmptyDir at `/etc/unbound/keys` for Unbound control keys shared with the exporter
- Image pull secret reference: `imagepullsecret` (patch or replace for your registry).

### External inputs you must provide

- Publish or point the Deployment images to your registry (`unbound` and `unbound_exporter`).
- Provide upstream DNS forwarders by replacing `local.conf.d/patchme.conf` (the source for `forwarders.conf`) with the `forward-zone`/`stub-zone` config your environment requires.
- Ensure the `imagepullsecret` exists in the namespace or update the Deployment to the correct secret name.
- Optionally tighten `access_control.conf` to limit which networks can query the resolver.

### Quick start

1. Add your upstream resolver config to `local.conf.d/patchme.conf` (or replace the `forwarders.conf` entry in kustomization) and update the container images.
2. Confirm the image pull secret name matches your registry credentials.
3. Deploy Unbound:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k deploy/carbide-unbound-base -n <CARBIDE_NAMESPACE>
   ```

---

## Components

**Role**  
Reusable Kustomize components that layer registry credentials and boot artifact sidecars onto Carbide workloads.

### What it includes

Path: `deploy/components/`

- Component `boot-artifacts-containers` – JSON6902 patch that adds an EmptyDir volume plus sidecar containers to `carbide-pxe` and `carbide-api` Deployments. The sidecars copy `x86_64`, `aarch64`, `apt`, `firmware`, and machine-validation artifacts into `/forge-boot-artifacts/blobs/internal`, including a legacy x86_64 image for backward compatibility.
- Component `imagepullsecret` – JSON6902 patch that injects an `imagepullsecret` reference into all Deployments, Jobs, and StatefulSets.

### External inputs you must provide

- Publish the boot artifact container images (x86_64, aarch64, legacy x86_64, machine-validation) to your registry and override the placeholders in the parent Kustomization.
- Create the `imagepullsecret` Secret in the target namespace or change the referenced name in the patch.

### Quick start

1. Add the components to your overlay:

   ```yaml
   components:
     - ../components/boot-artifacts-containers
     - ../components/imagepullsecret
   ```

2. Ensure the boot artifact images are available and the `imagepullsecret` exists.
3. Components are used in `forge-system` kustomization
---

**Role**  
Reference overlay that deploys Carbide + Unbound into the `forge-system` namespace with external access points and environment defaults.

### What it deploys

Path: `deploy/forge-system/`

- Namespace `forge-system` plus a Kustomize base that pulls in `../carbide-base` and `../carbide-unbound-base`.
- Components `../components/imagepullsecret` and `../components/boot-artifacts-containers`.
- External `Service`s for DHCP, PXE (80/8080), API (443→1079), SSH console (22), DNS (per‑pod TCP/UDP 53), and NTP (per‑pod UDP 123).
- ConfigMaps generated for `carbide-dns`, `forge-system-carbide-database-config`, and `vault-cluster-info` with default literals for this environment.
- Certificate patches that add namespace‑specific DNSNames and SPIFFE URIs for all Carbide cert-manager `Certificate`s, plus a patch targeting the `forge-pg-cluster` Postgres resource.
- Name suffix hashing disabled to keep stable names.

### External inputs you must provide

- Assign LoadBalancer IPs / addresses for the external Services (for example via the parent `deploy/kustomization.yaml` Metallb patches) or adapt to your cloud LB configuration.
- Ensure the `forge-pg-cluster` Postgres instance and the secret referenced by `SECRET_REF` exist, or update the literals.
- Point the Vault settings (`VAULT_SERVICE`, mounts) at your Vault cluster, or patch the ConfigMap.
- Provide the `imagepullsecret` Secret in `forge-system` and publish the boot artifact images referenced by the components.

### Quick start

1. Update the literals and image overrides in `deploy/forge-system/kustomization.yaml` (and the top-level `deploy/kustomization.yaml` if you use the Metallb IP patches) to match your environment.
2. Apply the overlay:

   ```bash
   kubectl apply -k deploy/forge-system
   ```

3. Confirm LoadBalancer IPs are assigned and cert-manager issues the Carbide certificates.
