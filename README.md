# NCX Infra Controller

NCX Infra Controller (NICo) delivers zero-touch lifecycle automation for bare-metal
systems that secures datacenter infrastructure at its foundation.

It is an API-based microservice that provides site-local, zero-trust,
bare-metal lifecycle management with DPU-enforced isolation. NICo automates the complexity
of the bare-metal lifecycle to fast-track building next generation AI Cloud offerings.

## Getting Started

- Go to the [NCX Infra Controller overview](https://docs.nvidia.com/infra-controller/documentation/introduction.html) to get an overview of NICo architecture and capabilities.
- Or jump to the [Site Setup guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/infra-controller/documentation/manuals/site-setup.html) to start setting up your site for NICo.
- Or jump to the [Building Containers guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/infra-controller/documentation/manuals/building-ni-co-containers.html) to see an overview for building the containers.
- Check out [Local Development with DevSpace](dev/deployment/devspace/README.md) to run NICo locally with mock systems.

## Bare-Metal Cluster Setup

`helm-prereqs/setup.sh` deploys the full NCX stack onto a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster in three layers:

| Layer | What it installs | Helm release |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Common services** | MetalLB, cert-manager, Vault, external-secrets, PostgreSQL | via `helmfile` in `helm-prereqs/` |
| **Carbide Core** | NCX Infra Controller (this repo's `helm/` chart) | `carbide` in `forge-system` |
| **Carbide REST** | NCX REST API, Temporal, Keycloak, site-agent | `carbide-rest` + `carbide-rest-site-agent` in `carbide-rest` |

### Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster with `KUBECONFIG` set
- `helm`, `helmfile`, `kubectl`, `jq` installed
- Images pushed to your container registry

### Quick start

```bash
# 1. Build and push images to your registry
#    Carbide Core image: <your-registry>/nvmetal-carbide:<tag>  (this repo)
#    Carbide REST images: <your-registry>/carbide-rest-api:<tag>, etc.  (ncx-infra-controller-rest)

# 2. Set environment variables
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
export REGISTRY_PULL_SECRET=<your-registry-pull-secret-or-ngc-api-key>
export NCX_IMAGE_REGISTRY=<your-registry>        # e.g. my-registry.example.com/ncx
export NCX_CORE_IMAGE_TAG=<carbide-core-tag>     # e.g. v2025.12.30
export NCX_REST_IMAGE_TAG=<carbide-rest-tag>     # e.g. v1.0.4

# 3. Customize site-specific values
#    Edit helm-prereqs/values/ncx-core.yaml:
#      carbide-api.hostname      — your site's external API hostname
#      carbide-api.siteConfig    — network pools, VLAN ranges, IB config, MetalLB VIPs
#    Edit helm-prereqs/values/metallb-config.yaml:
#      IPAddressPool, BGPPeer    — your site's VIP ranges and TOR switch config
#    Edit helm-prereqs/values.yaml:
#      siteName                  — short site identifier

# 4. Point NCX_REPO at ncx-infra-controller-rest (auto-detected if a sibling directory)
export NCX_REPO=/path/to/ncx-infra-controller-rest   # optional

# 5. Run setup — installs common services, Carbide Core, and Carbide REST in order
cd helm-prereqs
./setup.sh        # interactive
./setup.sh -y     # non-interactive (CI/CD)
```

To tear everything down:

```bash
cd helm-prereqs
./clean.sh
```
