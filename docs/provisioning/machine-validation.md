# Machine Validation <Badge intent="info">v2.0</Badge>

Machine Validation is NVIDIA Infra Controller's in-band validation framework for
checking a machine before it is made available to tenants. NICo uses Scout to run
validation tests on the host, collect the results, and report them back to the
site controller.

The framework is intended to be extensible. NICo provides a catalog of built-in
hardware validation tests, and site administrators can add site-specific tests
when the deployment enables test mutation workflows.

## Summary

Machine Validation helps operators answer a simple question: is this machine
healthy enough to enter or return to the tenant-ready pool?

NICo can run validation during lifecycle workflows such as discovery and release,
and administrators can also start validation on demand for a specific machine.
Each validation run selects tests based on context, platform support, test
enablement, verification state, tags, and any allow list supplied by the
operator.

In normal lifecycle validation, NICo runs only tests that are both enabled and
verified. Unverified tests can be exercised through on-demand validation before
they are promoted into the standard workflow.

## Audience

This guide is written for site administrators, SREs, platform administrators, and
developers who manage or extend NICo machine validation. The examples assume the
operator has access to the target site through `nico-admin-cli` and has the
permissions required to view or modify machine validation configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before using Machine Validation, confirm the following:

- Machine Validation is enabled for the site.
- The operator has privileges to view validation runs and manage validation
  tests.
- The target machine is under platform control and is not allocated to a tenant.
- Required validation images, tools, and external configs are available for the
  selected tests.

## How Machine Validation Fits Into NICo

Machine Validation runs while a machine is under platform control and before it
is allocated to a tenant. Typical entry points include:

- Initial discovery, before a newly discovered machine reaches `Ready`.
- Cleanup or release workflows, before a returned machine is made available
  again.
- On-demand validation, when an administrator explicitly starts validation for a
  machine that needs additional checks.

Machine Validation complements SKU validation. SKU validation checks that the
machine inventory matches the expected hardware model. Machine Validation runs
tests on the machine to prove that the hardware and relevant host-side software
paths behave correctly.

## Framework Concepts

| Concept | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Validation run | One execution of Machine Validation for a machine. A run contains the selected tests and their results. |
| Test definition | The stored definition of a validation test, including command, arguments, image, contexts, supported platforms, timeout, tags, and version. |
| Context | The lifecycle situation in which a test is eligible to run. Common contexts are `Discovery`, `Cleanup`, and `OnDemand`. |
| Platform mapping | The list of machine platforms on which a test is supported. Scout uses the discovered machine platform to select compatible tests. |
| Enabled flag | Controls whether the test is eligible for selection. Disabled tests are not selected for normal validation. |
| Verified flag | Indicates that an administrator has validated the test itself. Normal lifecycle runs skip unverified tests. |
| Tags | Optional selectors that allow administrators to group tests and run targeted suites. |
| External config | A named configuration file, such as registry credentials, that can be referenced by a test without embedding secrets in the test command. |
| Result | The recorded output for one test execution, including status, timing, exit code, and captured output. |

## Test Selection

When a validation run starts, NICo and Scout select tests using the following
criteria:

1. The Machine Validation feature must be enabled for the site.
2. The test must be enabled, unless the site configuration explicitly overrides
   the catalog selection mode.
3. The test must be verified for normal lifecycle runs.
4. The test context must match the run context, such as `Discovery`, `Cleanup`,
   or `OnDemand`.
5. The test must support the machine platform.
6. If tags are supplied, the test must match the requested tags.
7. If an allow list is supplied, the test must be included in the allow list.

On-demand validation can intentionally include unverified tests by using the
current CLI flag `--run-unverfied-tests`. The spelling of `unverfied` is part of
the current CLI interface and must be used exactly as shown.

## Built-In Validation Coverage

The exact test IDs, versions, enabled state, and supported platforms are
deployment and release specific. Use `nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests
show` as the source of truth for the running site.

The built-in catalog commonly includes the following test groups:

| Area | Common tests | What they validate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GPU health | `CudaSample`, `DcgmFullShort`, `DcgmFullLong` | CUDA execution, DCGM diagnostics, and basic GPU health. |
| GPU performance | `Nvbandwidth`, `RaytracingVk` | GPU memory bandwidth and graphics or compute paths used by supported platforms. |
| CPU | `CPUTestShort`, `CPUTestLong`, `CpuBenchmarkingFp`, `CpuBenchmarkingInt` | CPU stress and benchmark coverage for short and long validation windows. |
| Memory | `MemoryTestShort`, `MemoryTestLong`, `MmMemBandwidth`, `MmMemLatency`, `MmMemPeakBandwidth`, `MqStresserShort`, `MqStresserLong` | Memory stress, latency, bandwidth, and queue pressure. |
| Storage | `FioFile`, `FioPath`, `FioSSD` | File, path, and device-level I/O validation with fio-based tests. |
| Operational extensions | `DefaultTestCase`, runbook-style tests | Site or release-specific checks used to extend the validation workflow. |

Built-in tests that are delivered through NICo migrations are normally
read-only. Site-specific tests can be added and modified by administrators when
the deployment enables those mutation APIs.

## Site Configuration

Machine Validation is controlled by the site configuration. A minimal
configuration enables the feature:

```toml
[machine_validation_config]
enabled = true
```

A site can also control the catalog selection behavior:

```toml
[machine_validation_config]
enabled = true
test_selection_mode = "Default"
run_interval = "60s"
stale_run_timeout = "24h"
tests = [
  { id = "CudaSample", enable = true },
]
```

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `enabled` | Enables or disables Machine Validation for the site. |
| `test_selection_mode` | Controls how configured tests are selected. `Default` uses the catalog and per-test settings, `EnableAll` enables all configured tests, and `DisableAll` disables all configured tests. |
| `run_interval` | Controls how often the controller processes pending validation work. |
| `stale_run_timeout` | Grace period before an active validation run is considered stale. The default is `24h`; configured values below `90s` are raised to `90s` so healthy runs are not failed between Scout heartbeats. |
| `tests` | Optional per-test overrides. Use the test identifiers reported by `tests show` for the running site. |

For container plugins, the site policy explicitly allows the supported plugin
type and image registry. An empty `allowed_plugin_types` list disables plugin
registration. Legacy tests are unaffected.

```toml
[machine_validation_config]
allowed_plugin_types = ["container"]
approved_plugin_registries = ["registry.example.com"]
allow_privileged_plugins = false
allow_full_host_plugins = false
```

Attempt logs default to enabled, with a 16 KiB chunk limit, a 1 MiB per-attempt
limit, and 30-day retention. Setting `enabled = false` makes NICo discard log
chunks. When enabled, both size limits must be greater than zero,
`max_chunk_bytes` must not exceed `max_attempt_bytes`, and the largest allowed
values are 16 KiB and 1 MiB respectively. `retention` accepts a non-negative
duration and controls when terminal-attempt logs are removed.

```toml
[machine_validation_config.attempt_logs]
enabled = true
max_chunk_bytes = 16384
max_attempt_bytes = 1048576
retention = "30d"
```

## External Configuration

Some validation tests require external configuration, such as container registry
credentials. Store those inputs as named external configs instead of embedding
secrets in test definitions.

For example, to add or update the container authentication file:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation external-config add-update \
  --name container_auth \
  --description "Container registry credentials for machine validation" \
  --file-name /tmp/config.json
```

To view or remove external configuration:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation external-config show --name container_auth
nico-admin-cli machine-validation external-config remove --name container_auth
```

## Managing the Test Catalog

### List Tests

Use the test catalog to see the tests available in the site:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests show
```

Show a specific test:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests show --test-id <test_id>
```

Filter by platform or context:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests show --platforms <platform>
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests show --contexts Discovery
```

Show unverified tests:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests show --show-un-verfied
```

The current CLI flag is spelled `--show-un-verfied`; use the spelling shown
above.

### Enable or Disable Tests

Enable a test when it should be eligible for selection:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests enable \
  --test-id <test_id> \
  --version <version>
```

Disable a test when it should not be selected:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests disable \
  --test-id <test_id> \
  --version <version>
```

Use the `test_id` and `version` values returned by `tests show`.

### Verify Tests

Verify a test after it has been proven safe and correct for the target site:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests verify \
  --test-id <test_id> \
  --version <version>
```

Verification is a promotion step. A newly added test should be run on demand
first, reviewed, and then marked verified before it is allowed into normal
lifecycle validation.

## Adding Site-Specific Tests

When test mutation workflows are enabled for the deployment, administrators can
add tests to extend the validation framework. A site-specific test should be
small, deterministic, non-interactive, and safe to run under platform control.

The following example adds a host-side smoke test:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests add \
  --name AcmeGpuSmoke \
  --description "Runs the Acme GPU smoke validation" \
  --command /usr/local/bin/acme-gpu-smoke \
  --args "--quick" \
  --contexts OnDemand \
  --supported-platforms <platform> \
  --timeout 1800 \
  --is-enabled false
```

The following example adds a container-based test:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests add \
  --name AcmeContainerHealth \
  --description "Runs Acme container health checks" \
  --command /opt/acme/health-check \
  --args "" \
  --img-name nvcr.io/nvidian/nvforge/acme-health:1.0.0 \
  --contexts Discovery \
  --supported-platforms <platform> \
  --external-config-file container_auth \
  --timeout 3600 \
  --is-enabled false
```

After adding a test:

1. Run it on demand with `--run-unverfied-tests`.
2. Review the result output.
3. Enable the test if it should be selected.
4. Verify the test after it is accepted for normal validation.

## Execution Models

Machine Validation tests can be implemented as host commands or container-based
commands.

| Model | When to use it | Common fields |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Host command | Use when the test tool is already present in the discovery environment or host filesystem. | `--command`, `--args`, `--timeout` |
| Container command | Use when the test needs a packaged dependency set or must run from a validation image. | `--img-name`, `--container-arg`, `--external-config-file` |
| Host filesystem execution | Use when a containerized test must execute against the host filesystem. | `--execute-in-host true` |

Tests can also declare output file locations with `--extra-output-file` and
`--extra-err-file` when a command writes important diagnostics outside stdout or
stderr. Keep those outputs concise. Scout records command output for result
review, but Machine Validation is not a replacement for long-term log storage.

## Run Tracking and Stale Recovery

Machine Validation tracks active work at two levels:

- Run items show which tests were selected for a validation run.
- Attempts show each execution of a selected test, including state, timing, exit
  code, and output summaries.

Scout sends heartbeats while tests are running. The controller uses the latest
heartbeat to find work that stopped making progress. If a record has no
heartbeat, the controller falls back to the run start time, expected duration,
and `stale_run_timeout`.

When stale work is found, the controller fails the validation and records the
normal failed-validation health alert. This keeps a machine from staying stuck
in an active validation state after Scout stops reporting.

Operators can monitor this behavior with:

| Metric | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `carbide_machine_validation_oldest_active_age_seconds` | Age of the oldest active validation run. |
| `carbide_machine_validation_stale_runs_count` | Number of active validation runs considered stale in the latest reconciliation pass. |

## Database Changes and Upgrades

Recent Machine Validation reliability work introduced database schema changes
for execution tracking and stale recovery:

| Area | Database change |
| --- | --- |
| Execution tracking | Adds `machine_validation_run_items` and `machine_validation_attempts` tables. |
| Heartbeat recovery | Adds `machine_validation.last_heartbeat_at` and heartbeat indexes for active validations, run items, and attempts. |

Deployments must apply the normal API database migrations before relying on the
new run tracking and stale recovery behavior. No manual data backfill is
required for existing validation rows. Older rows without heartbeat timestamps
continue to use the duration-based stale detection fallback.

## Updating Site-Specific Tests

Use `tests update` to change a mutable test definition:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation tests update \
  --test-id <test_id> \
  --version <version> \
  --timeout 3600 \
  --description "Updated validation timeout"
```

Use updates for site-specific tests only. Built-in tests may be read-only,
depending on how they were delivered to the site.

## Extension Design Guidelines

Use the following guidelines when designing a new validation test:

| Area | Recommendation |
| --- | --- |
| Naming | Use a stable, descriptive PascalCase name such as `GpuFabricSmoke` or `StorageFioPath`. Avoid embedding temporary incident names or one-off ticket IDs. |
| Scope | Keep each test focused on one hardware or software concern. Prefer separate tests over a large script that hides multiple failure modes. |
| Contexts | Use `Discovery` for pre-allocation checks, `Cleanup` for checks after release, and `OnDemand` for operator-triggered validation or test qualification. |
| Platform support | Map tests only to platforms where the command, devices, firmware, and drivers are expected to exist. |
| Verification | Treat verification as a release gate for the test definition. Do not verify a test until it has passed on representative hardware. |
| Timeouts | Set an explicit timeout that matches the expected runtime. Long tests should be intentional and documented. |
| Secrets | Use external config files for credentials and sensitive inputs. Do not pass secrets directly in command arguments. |
| Output | Write concise stdout and stderr that explains what failed. Use extra output files only for diagnostics that cannot be emitted directly. |
| Pre-conditions | Use pre-conditions to skip tests that do not apply to a machine rather than failing unrelated platforms. |
| Tags | Add tags when operators need to run a targeted suite such as `gpu-smoke`, `storage`, or `burn-in`. |

## Running On-Demand Validation

Start validation for a specific machine:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation on-demand start --machine <machine_id>
```

Run only selected contexts:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation on-demand start \
  --machine <machine_id> \
  --contexts OnDemand
```

Run selected tests:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation on-demand start \
  --machine <machine_id> \
  --allowed-tests <test_id_1> \
  --allowed-tests <test_id_2>
```

Run a tagged suite:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation on-demand start \
  --machine <machine_id> \
  --tags gpu-smoke
```

Run unverified tests during qualification:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation on-demand start \
  --machine <machine_id> \
  --allowed-tests <test_id> \
  --run-unverfied-tests
```

The current CLI flag is spelled `--run-unverfied-tests`; use the spelling shown
above.

## Viewing Runs and Results

Show validation runs:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation runs show
```

Show runs for one machine:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation runs show --machine <machine_id>
```

Include historical runs:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation runs show --machine <machine_id> --history
```

Show validation results for a machine:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation results show --machine <machine_id>
```

Show results for a specific validation run:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation results show --validation-id <validation_id>
```

Show a specific test result from a run:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation results show \
  --validation-id <validation_id> \
  --test-name <test_name>
```

## Viewing Plugin Attempt Logs

Plugin stdout and stderr are available while an attempt runs when site attempt-log
storage is enabled. Find the run ID with `runs show`, then follow the current
attempt for a test:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation runs show --machine <machine_id>
nico-admin-cli machine-validation logs follow \
  --validation-id <validation_id> --test-id <test_id>
```

`follow` prints stored output first, polls once per second, and exits when the
attempt finishes. List current and earlier attempts for a test to find their
UUIDs:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation logs attempts \
  --validation-id <validation_id> --test-id <test_id>
```

Then inspect one attempt:

```sh
nico-admin-cli machine-validation logs show --attempt-id <attempt_id>
nico-admin-cli machine-validation logs follow --attempt-id <attempt_id>
```

Both commands show the server timestamp, source stream, and first sequence for
each complete line. A partial line is printed when the source stream changes,
when `show` finishes, or when the attempt becomes terminal. Use `--raw` to
print chunk content immediately without metadata, or `--stdout-only` or
`--stderr-only` to filter by stream. The
run-and-test selector resolves the test's latest attempt; use an attempt ID for
earlier attempts. Logs are best effort: a full Scout buffer or the site's
per-attempt storage limit may omit some output.

## Interpreting Results

Each test result records the command execution outcome, timing, exit code, and
captured output. A non-zero exit code indicates failure unless the test command
implements a documented skip or pre-condition behavior.

Scout captures bounded stdout and stderr for the final result. Container plugin
attempts also stream bounded output while running when attempt-log storage is
enabled. Built-in tests do not use this plugin log stream. Tests should print
useful progress and final diagnostic information without unbounded output.

When a validation run fails, review:

- Whether the selected test is supported on the machine platform.
- Whether the test was verified and enabled intentionally.
- The command exit code and captured output.
- Any referenced external configuration.
- Whether the test timed out.
- Whether a pre-condition skipped or changed the intended execution path.

## Operational Guidance

Use Machine Validation as a controlled pre-allocation gate. Do not enable or
verify a new test in the standard lifecycle until it has been qualified with
on-demand runs on representative hardware.

For production sites:

- Keep the built-in catalog enabled according to the site's hardware and release
  policy.
- Use short tests for routine lifecycle validation and long tests for burn-in,
  repair validation, or targeted on-demand workflows.
- Prefer tags and allow lists for targeted validation instead of modifying the
  global catalog for temporary needs.
- Keep site-specific test names stable across releases so operators can compare
  historical results.
- Store registry credentials and sensitive test inputs as external config.
- Review the output format of extension tests so failures are actionable from
  the CLI and admin UI.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Common causes | Next step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No tests are selected | Feature disabled, tests disabled, tests unverified, context mismatch, platform mismatch, tags do not match, or allow list excludes all tests. | Run `tests show` with the relevant platform and context, and confirm enabled and verified state. |
| A new test does not run in lifecycle validation | The test is unverified or disabled. | Run the test on demand with `--run-unverfied-tests`, review the result, then enable and verify it. |
| After modifying or updating a test, I no longer see the test | The updated test may have become unverified, or the current `tests show` filter may exclude its new context, platform, or version. | Run `tests show --show-un-verfied --test-id <test_id>`, review the updated definition, then re-enable or re-verify the test as needed. |
| A test fails only on one platform | Platform mapping is too broad, platform-specific dependency is missing, or the test command assumes hardware that is not present. | Restrict `supported-platforms` or add a pre-condition. |
| A container test cannot start | Image name, registry credentials, or external config are incorrect. | Confirm the image exists and refresh `container_auth`. |
| A test times out | Timeout is too short, the test is hung, or the machine is unhealthy. | Review captured output and set a deliberate timeout for the test's expected runtime. |
| Result output is incomplete | The test wrote too much output or logs outside captured stdout and stderr. | Keep CLI output concise and write important diagnostics before exit. |
