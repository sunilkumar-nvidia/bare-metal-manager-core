# On-Demand Rack Maintenance

On-demand maintenance allows an operator to trigger a maintenance cycle on a rack that is in the **Ready** or **Error** state. It supports both **full-rack** and **partial-rack** scoping — the caller can optionally specify which machines, switches, or power shelves to maintain, and which maintenance **activities** to perform.

## Scope: Full Rack vs Partial Rack

The maintenance request carries an optional **`MaintenanceScope`** that specifies which devices to include:

| Scenario | `machine_ids` | `switch_ids` | `power_shelf_ids` | Effect |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|--------|
| Full rack | *(empty)* | *(empty)* | *(empty)* | All machines, switches, and power shelves in the rack are maintained. |
| Machines only | `[id1, id2]` | *(empty)* | *(empty)* | Only the specified machines are reprovisioned and firmware-upgraded. Switches and power shelves are skipped. |
| Mixed | `[id1]` | `[sid1]` | *(empty)* | Only the listed machines and switches are maintained; power shelves are skipped. |

When no device IDs are specified (all three lists empty), the scope is treated as **full rack** — identical to the existing `reprovision_requested` behavior.

## Activities

The request also carries an optional list of **maintenance activities** to perform. When the list is empty, all activities are performed (the default). Available activities:

| Activity | Proto `oneof` variant | Per-activity config | Description |
|----------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Firmware Upgrade | `FirmwareUpgradeActivity` | `firmware_version` — target firmware ID (empty = default firmware for the rack hardware type) | Reprovisioning and firmware upgrade via RMS. |
| Configure NMX Cluster | `ConfigureNmxClusterActivity` | *(extend as needed)* | NMX cluster configuration. |
| Power Sequence | `PowerSequenceActivity` | *(extend as needed)* | Power-on/off/reset sequencing. |

Each activity is represented as a `MaintenanceActivityConfig` message with a `oneof activity` field. The `oneof` discriminant identifies the activity type, and each variant carries only the configuration fields relevant to that activity.

Activities that are not in the list are skipped during the maintenance cycle. The state machine always starts at `FirmwareUpgrade(Start)` (to consume the scope), but immediately advances to the next requested activity if firmware upgrade was not requested.

### Firmware Version Resolution

The firmware used during the upgrade depends on how the maintenance was triggered:

| Trigger | `firmware_version` | Firmware used |
|---------|-------------------|---------------|
| Ingestion (Discovering → Maintenance) | *(not applicable)* | Default firmware for the rack hardware type |
| Reprovision (`reprovision_requested`) | *(not applicable)* | Default firmware for the rack hardware type |
| On-demand CLI, no version specified | *(empty)* | Default firmware for the rack hardware type |
| On-demand CLI, version specified | e.g. `"fw-v2.1"` | Looked up by ID via `rack_firmware` table |

When a `firmware_version` is supplied through the CLI, the maintenance handler resolves it by looking up the firmware record by ID (`db_rack_firmware::find_by_id`). If the ID is not found, the rack transitions to **Error**. If the firmware exists but is not marked as available, the firmware upgrade is skipped. When no version is specified (or the maintenance was triggered through ingestion/reprovision), the default firmware for the rack's hardware type is used as before.

```

1. The caller invokes the `OnDemandRackMaintenance` gRPC method with a `rack_id` and optional device-ID lists.
2. The handler validates that the rack is in `Ready` or `Error` state and no maintenance is already pending.
3. It writes a `MaintenanceScope` to `RackConfig.maintenance_requested` and persists the config.
4. On the next state-handler tick, `handle_ready` detects `maintenance_requested` and transitions the rack to `Maintenance(FirmwareUpgrade(Start))`.
5. The `start_firmware_upgrade` function consumes the scope. If a `firmware_version` was specified, it resolves the firmware by ID; otherwise it uses the default firmware for the rack hardware type. It then filters device reprovisioning and firmware-upgrade operations to only the specified devices (or all devices if the scope is full-rack).
6. After maintenance completes, the rack flows through `Validating` back to `Ready` as usual.

## gRPC API

**Service method** (in `Forge` service):

```protobuf
rpc OnDemandRackMaintenance(RackMaintenanceOnDemandRequest) returns (RackMaintenanceOnDemandResponse);
```

**Messages**:

```protobuf
message FirmwareUpgradeActivity {
  string firmware_version = 1;          // empty = default firmware for rack hardware type
}
message ConfigureNmxClusterActivity {}  // extend as needed
message PowerSequenceActivity {}        // extend as needed

message MaintenanceActivityConfig {
  oneof activity {
    FirmwareUpgradeActivity firmware_upgrade = 1;
    ConfigureNmxClusterActivity configure_nmx_cluster = 2;
    PowerSequenceActivity power_sequence = 3;
  }
}

message RackMaintenanceScope {
  repeated string machine_ids = 1;
  repeated string switch_ids = 2;
  repeated string power_shelf_ids = 3;
  repeated MaintenanceActivityConfig activities = 4;  // empty = all
}

message RackMaintenanceOnDemandRequest {
  common.RackId rack_id = 1;
  RackMaintenanceScope scope = 2;  // unset/empty = full rack, all activities
}

message RackMaintenanceOnDemandResponse {}
```

## Component Manager Integration

The `UpdateComponentFirmware` gRPC endpoint provides a higher-level interface for firmware updates. For **compute trays** and **switches**, it delegates to the rack state machine by internally calling `on_demand_rack_maintenance`, rather than managing firmware directly.

### How it works

When `update_component_firmware` receives a request targeting compute trays or switches:

1. **Resolve the rack** — looks up the first device (machine or switch) in the database to find its `rack_id`.
2. **Build a maintenance request** — constructs a `RackMaintenanceOnDemandRequest` with:
   - The resolved `rack_id`
   - The machine IDs and/or switch IDs from the request
   - A `FirmwareUpgrade` activity carrying the `target_version` as `firmware_version`
3. **Delegate** — calls `on_demand_rack_maintenance`, which writes the `MaintenanceScope` to the rack config and lets the rack state machine handle the actual firmware upgrade.
4. **Return success** — once the maintenance is scheduled, returns a success `ComponentResult` for each device.

Power shelves continue to use the component manager backend directly (they do not go through the rack state machine).

| Target type | Behavior |
|-------------|----------|
| `ComputeTrays` | Resolves `rack_id` from first machine, delegates to `on_demand_rack_maintenance` with `machine_ids` and `firmware_version` |
| `Switches` | Resolves `rack_id` from first switch, delegates to `on_demand_rack_maintenance` with `switch_ids` and `firmware_version` |
| `PowerShelves` | Handled directly by the component manager power shelf backend (no state machine interaction) |

### Example: CLI triggers compute tray firmware upgrade

```bash
carbide-cli component firmware update \
  --compute-trays machine-001,machine-002 \
  --target-version fw-v2.1
```

This results in:

1. `UpdateComponentFirmware` is called with `ComputeTrays { machine_ids: [machine-001, machine-002] }` and `target_version: "fw-v2.1"`.
2. Machine `machine-001` is looked up to discover `rack_id = rack-42`.
3. `OnDemandRackMaintenance` is called with `rack_id = rack-42`, `machine_ids = [machine-001, machine-002]`, and `FirmwareUpgradeActivity { firmware_version: "fw-v2.1" }`.
4. The rack state machine picks up the request, resolves firmware `fw-v2.1` from the `rack_firmware` table, and runs the firmware upgrade via RMS for the specified machines.

## Preconditions

The gRPC handler rejects the request with an error if:

- The rack is **not in `Ready` or `Error` state** — maintenance can only be triggered from these two states.
- A maintenance request is **already pending** (`maintenance_requested` is already set).
- Any provided device ID is **malformed** (cannot be parsed).

## RBAC

The `OnDemandRackMaintenance` permission is granted to the `ForgeAdminCLI` role.

## Failure Handling

If the maintenance state machine transitions to `Error` (for example, a
firmware upgrade fails, the requested rack firmware cannot be found, or RMS is
unreachable), the handler clears `maintenance_requested` while persisting the
`Error` transition.

This is important because `handle_error` re-enters `Maintenance` whenever
`maintenance_requested` is set; without clearing it, the rack would loop
between `Maintenance` and `Error` on the same failing request. The user must
issue a new `OnDemandRackMaintenance` call to retry.

### Restarting a compute stuck in `FailedFirmwareUpgrade`

A compute tray whose host firmware upgrade fails lands in
`M_HostReprovision::FailedFirmwareUpgrade`. From there it normally retries
automatically (bounded by `MAX_FIRMWARE_UPGRADE_RETRIES` and
`host_firmware_upgrade_retry_interval`).

When an on-demand maintenance call (or, equivalently, the rack maintenance
flow) issues a fresh `trigger_host_reprovisioning_request` against such a
machine, `host_reprovisioning_requested` is overwritten with
`started_at = None`. The `FailedFirmwareUpgrade` arm in
`HostUpgradeState::handle_host_reprovision` detects this fresh request
(`started_at.is_none()`) and:

- For rack-initiated requests (initiator prefixed `rack-`), transitions to
  `M_HostReprovision::WaitingForRackFirmwareUpgrade` so the rack-level RMS
  flow can drive the upgrade.
- Otherwise transitions to `M_HostReprovision::CheckingFirmwareV2` with
  `retry_count` reset to `0`, mirroring the way `ManagedHostState::Ready`
  kicks off a Host Reprovision (including the `host-fw-update` health-report
  alert merge).

This means an on-demand maintenance call always converges a stuck compute back
toward `M_Ready` without waiting for the auto-retry interval, which is what
allows the rack to progress out of `R_Maintenance` into `R_Validation`.

## Ready State Priority

When the rack is in `Ready`, three config flags are checked in order. The first match wins:

1. **`topology_changed`** → transition to `Discovering`
2. **`reprovision_requested`** → transition to `Maintenance(FirmwareUpgrade/Start)` *(clears any pending `maintenance_requested`)*
3. **`maintenance_requested`** → transition to `Maintenance(FirmwareUpgrade/Start)` with device scope
